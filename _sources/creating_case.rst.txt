Stages of Creating a Case 
==========================

The workflow for creating a CESM case using visualCaseGen is divided into three main stages:

1. **Compset**: In this stage, the user will select the compset, i.e., the set of models, physics, and options that will be used in the simulation.
2. **Resolution**: In this stage, the user will select the resolution of the simulation, i.e., the collection of model grids.
3. **Launch**: In this final stage, the user will create and configure the case.

Proceed to the following sections to learn more about each stage.
